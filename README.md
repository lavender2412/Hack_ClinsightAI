# ClinsightAI - Clinical Hospital Insight Analysis

## 🏥 Project Overview

**ClinsightAI** (Code_Blooded_ClinsightAI) is an advanced clinical intelligence platform designed to analyze hospital operations, patient data, and care quality metrics. This project leverages data-driven insights to identify systemic issues, recurring problems, and actionable improvement roadmaps for healthcare institutions.

The system processes hospital datasets to generate comprehensive reports at multiple analytical levels (review-level, theme-level) and creates strategic recommendations for operational improvements.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-Level Analysis**: Analyze hospital data at review, theme, and systemic levels
- **Quality Metric Identification**: Detect and track quality issues and their patterns
- **Systemic Problem Detection**: Identify recurring systemic issues in hospital operations
- **Action Roadmap Generation**: Create prioritized action plans for hospital improvements
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: Automated pipeline for transforming raw hospital data into actionable insights
- **JSON & CSV Output**: Generate outputs in multiple formats for further analysis and reporting


## 📊 Data Files

### Input Data
- **hospital.csv**: Contains raw hospital operational data including patient reviews, quality metrics, and facility information

### Output Files
- **clinsight_output.json**: Structured JSON output with comprehensive insights
- **review_level_outputs.csv**: Granular analysis at individual review level
- **theme_level_outputs.csv**: Aggregated insights grouped by themes/categories
- **task3_recurring_systemic.csv**: Analysis of recurring and systemic problems
- **task4_action_roadmap.csv**: Prioritized action items and improvement recommendations

💻 Usage

Running the Data Processing Pipeline

Execute the main pipeline to process hospital data and generate all outputs:

bash
python run_pipeline.py
This will:

Load hospital data from hospital.csv
Process and analyze the data through multiple analysis layers
Generate CSV outputs (review-level, theme-level, systemic, and roadmap)
Create structured JSON output (clinsight_output.json)
Running the Web Application

Launch the interactive Streamlit dashboard:

bash
streamlit run app.py
This provides a user-friendly interface to:

Explore hospital insights
